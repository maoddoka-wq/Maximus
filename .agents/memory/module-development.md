description: Rules for making future MAXIMUS modules reusable by any authorized company and easy for a human developer to extend.
---

A MAXIMUS module is designed and implemented independently of any company, as a complete reusable business tool. Authorized companies are consumers of the catalog module; they receive access and configuration separately. KORA is only demo data and must never be a module-specific fallback or hardcoded tenant.

**Why:** Treating a module as belonging to one company reverses the product model, encourages client-specific copies, and makes the catalog impossible to reuse consistently.

**How to apply:** Give each module a stable id and its own business contract, keep its Laravel routes/controllers/services/tests and frontend API/pages grouped, separate the global module definition from company access/configuration, require server-side company context for tenant data, and ship the module with a human-readable guide and isolation tests.
